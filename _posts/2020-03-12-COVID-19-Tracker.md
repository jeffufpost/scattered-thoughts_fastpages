## About

There are already many great ways to visualize the spread of sars-cov-2 around the world. I've made another one for family and friends that has the world on one page and France on another.

You can click on the countries for more details on the world map.

Likewise you can click on specific departments to see more detail on the French map.
    
The world map uses [data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) aggregated by the John Hopkins University CSSE.
    
The french map uses hospitalization and intensive care [data](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-hospitalieres-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid-19/) from Sante Publique France.
    
## Future blog post about building the site
    
The site is built using [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) and deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).

I will likely make a blog post detailing how to build the app and deploy it.
